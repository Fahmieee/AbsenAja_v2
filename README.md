# alco_safe

Simple school project.

A QR SCanner flutter app to test for fake unregistered alcohol.

It works by scanning a printed QR or Bar code, and checks it against a database. If it is available, it identifies it. If it isn't, it marks the code as unregistered, and gives an option to report it via email. 

It has a login and registration page,
A Tabbed layout that can scan qr or bar codes and compare them to those stored in a specified database (currently uses 000webhost. It's Free!!)
A simple profile page.

Has a customized navbar (using help from one of the projects here in github: bottomnavybar)

You need the php files from the php folder to connect to a database.
Then create an images and users folder in the server side. (000webhost)
And a database.
