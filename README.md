# alco_safe

A simple QR SCanner flutter app to test for fake alcohol.

It has a login and registration page,
A Tabbed layout that can scan qr or bar codes and compare them to those stored in a specified database (currently uses 000webhost. It's Free!!)
A simple Cart implementation.
A simple profile page.

Has a customized navbar (using help from one of the projects here in github: bottomnavybar)

You need the php files from the php folder to connect to a database.
Then create an images and users folder in the server side. (000webhost)
And a database.
